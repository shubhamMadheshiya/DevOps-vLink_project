# This file provides documentation for the roles used in the Ansible project. 
# It typically describes the purpose and usage of the roles.

# Example of a role structure:
# roles/
# ├── role_name/
# │   ├── tasks/
# │   │   └── main.yml
# │   ├── handlers/
# │   │   └── main.yml
# │   ├── templates/
# │   ├── files/
# │   └── vars/
# │       └── main.yml

# To use a role in a playbook, you can include it as follows:
# - hosts: all
#   roles:
#     - role_name

# Replace 'role_name' with the actual name of the role you are documenting. 
# Ensure to provide clear instructions on how to use each role and any variables that can be configured.
